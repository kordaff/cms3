# cms3
This will be the 3rd iteration of my mod_perl2 response handler that acts as a CMS using Apache and PostgreSQL.


Added my TODO's for this module on http://userconfig.cf/ where I'll be testing it, but think I need to move the TODO's at least, off to http://perl-user.com/cms3-todos-4-userconfig since once I reconfigure Apache, the TODO's won't be on userconfig.cf anymore...
